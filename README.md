# Stock-Market-Predictor-Incomplete-Deprecated
## A little background:
The much more ambitious predecessor to my stock quote growth program, this was a summer personal project of mine attempting to utilize webscraping to gather data to then try to make predictions with. I unfortunately never quite got an accurate algorithm going, and the methods of attaining data are now deprecated due to Yahoo Finance putting their historical price data behind a paywall. However, I felt that this code was still worth uploading, as it demonstrates what I feel was a cool attempt to use web scraping for fintech purposes.
